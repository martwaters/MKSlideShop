# MKSlideShop
## Windows Slideshow Program

### Beware: This is not a shopping software!

MKSlideShop is a simple (C#/.Net) tool to automatically display pictures from my photo collection(s),<br> 
e.g. while I'm doing something else on the PC.

It offers some further simple features, which help me to make the program useful.<br>
Keeping it simple was one of the intentions.<br>
So I want to fill the shop shelfs by time if I want more features ...

It's yet English only. Some features are still hardwired (e.g. the fade-in timing or background color), which could be parameterized.<br>
Yet I did not need those parameters ...

Currently supported formats (**file extensions**): **jpg, bmp, tif**

Active screen elements have tooltips about there usage.<br>

The program is compiled with Visual Studio Version 17.3.4<br>
Setup is created with Inno Setup 6.2.1.
The program uses the MetadataExtractor by Drew Noakes,<br>the NLog logging packages and the APICodepack ShellExtensions.

Have fun<br>
Martin
